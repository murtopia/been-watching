# Session Status - October 19, 2025

**Status**: ✅ Major Progress - Data Migration Complete, UI Fixed
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025 12:45 PM
**Working Directory**: `/Users/Nick/Desktop/Been Watching Cursor/been-watching-v2`

---

## 🎯 Current State

### What's Working Perfectly ✅
1. **Watch Status UI** - Buttons correctly highlight when opening shows from lists
2. **Deletion System** - Unchecking watch status shows confirmation dialog, then removes show
3. **Data Import** - Successfully imported 131/141 shows from Nick's migration file
4. **Year Display** - Fixed to always show exactly 4 digits (no more "20241" bugs)
5. **Season Tracking** - All TV shows properly stored as individual seasons (e.g., `tv-12345-s1`)

### What's In Progress 🔄
- **Manual Additions**: Nick is manually adding 10 shows that failed TMDB matching
- **Production Deployment**: Local changes need to be pushed to Vercel

---

## 📊 Nick's Current Data

### Database Status
- **Want to Watch**: 26 shows (targeting 31 after manual adds)
- **Watching**: 13 shows ✅ (Complete!)
- **Watched**: 92 shows (targeting 97 after manual adds)
- **Total**: 131 shows imported with proper ratings (meh/like/love)

### Backups Created
- `scripts/backup-nick-1760895647993.json` - Backup before first failed import (239 watch_status, 180 ratings)
- `scripts/backup-before-reimport-1760896259024.json` - Backup before successful import (239 entries)

### Migration Files
- **Source**: `Nick been watching migration data.txt` (Nick's data only)
- **Reconciliation**: `nm migration review.txt` + `shows to fix temp.txt` (TMDB corrections)
- **Script Used**: `scripts/import-nick-only.js` ✅ Working correctly

## 🛠️ Today's Major Fixes

### 1. Watch Status Button Highlighting
**Problem**: When clicking a show from a list (e.g., "Task" from Watching), the modal opened but no buttons were highlighted.

**Root Cause**: [myshows/page.tsx:207](app/myshows/page.tsx#L207) was passing `media.id = tmdb_id` instead of the full database ID (e.g., `tv-12345-s1`)

**Fix**:
- Changed to `media.id = mediaItem.media.id` (line 207)
- Updated MediaDetailModal to detect correct ID format (lines 71-73)
- Added state reset when modal closes (lines 44-49)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/myshows/page.tsx`
- `components/media/MediaDetailModal.tsx`

### 2. Deletion Not Working
**Problem**: Unchecking a watch status button wouldn't remove the show from the list.

**Root Cause**: `handleMediaSelect` was constructing wrong mediaId (`tv-tv-12345-s1` instead of `tv-12345-s1`)

**Fix**:
- Added smart mediaId detection (lines 139-153 in myshows/page.tsx)
- Extracts mediaId if already in correct format, otherwise constructs it
- Fixed mediaType scoping issue that caused "mediaType is not defined" error

**Files Modified**:
- `app/myshows/page.tsx` (handleMediaSelect function)

### 3. Confirmation Dialog for Deletion
**New Feature**: Beautiful modal asks "Remove [Show Name] from [Want to Watch/Watching/Watched]?" before deletion

**Implementation**:
- Two-button design: "Cancel" (gray) and "Remove" (red)
- Shows show name and which list it's being removed from
- Only appears when unchecking a status (not when changing between statuses)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/myshows/page.tsx` (lines 809-891 for dialog JSX)
- `components/media/MediaDetailModal.tsx` (passes currentStatus to parent)

### 4. Year Display Bug
**Problem**: Some shows displayed years with 5 characters like "20241" or "2024X"

**Root Cause**: Using `new Date(releaseDate).getFullYear()` which could malfunction with malformed date strings

**Fix**: Changed to `releaseDate.substring(0, 4)` to always extract exactly 4 characters

**Files Modified**:
- `components/media/MediaCard.tsx` (line 86)

## 🗃️ Data Migration Details

### Shows That Failed TMDB Matching (10 total)

**Want to Watch (5 failed):**
1. **"Smithsonian's Spy Wars"** → Correct: "Spy Wars With Damian Lewis"
2. **"30 for 30. Lance Armstrong"** → Correct: "Lance" or search "ESPN 30 for 30"
3. **"Sicaro"** → Correct: "Sicario" (typo)
4. **"Alien Earth"** → Correct: "Alien: Earth" (FX/Hulu)
5. **"King of the Hill reboot"** → Correct: "King of the Hill" Season 14

**Watched (5 failed):**
1. **"Top Chef Wisconsin"** → Correct: "Top Chef" Season 21
2. **"Cowboy Bourbon"** → Need to identify correct show
3. **"Window Cliquot"** → Correct: "Widow Clicquot" (typo)
4. **"Number 24 Movie"** → Correct: "Number 24" (2024 movie)
5. **"The Fountain of Youth minus"** → Correct: "Fountain of Youth" (2025 movie)

### Rating System Mapping
From Apple Notes to Database:
- `*` (one star) → `meh`
- `**` (two stars) → `like`
- `***` (three stars) → `love`

### Season-Specific Logic
- **Want to Watch**: Only Season 1 imported for multi-season shows
- **Watching/Watched**: Specific seasons imported as listed (e.g., "Fargo s2" → Season 2)
- **Format**: All TV shows stored as `tv-{tmdb_id}-s{season_number}`
- **Never**: Full series without season number

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Fixed Today ✅
- ✅ Watch status buttons not highlighting
- ✅ Deletion not working when unchecking status
- ✅ Year displaying 5 characters instead of 4

## 💡 Important Notes

### DO NOT Run These Scripts
- ❌ `scripts/clean-and-reimport-nick.js` - Parses ALL users' data, not just Nick
- Use `scripts/import-nick-only.js` instead ✅

### Database IDs Format
- **Movies**: `movie-{tmdb_id}` (e.g., `movie-157336`)
- **TV Seasons**: `tv-{tmdb_id}-s{season_num}` (e.g., `tv-110492-s1`)
- **NEVER**: `tv-{tmdb_id}` without season number

### Rating Values
- `meh` - Didn't love it
- `like` - Enjoyed it
- `love` - Highly recommend

### Watch Status Values
- `want` - Want to Watch
- `watching` - Currently Watching
- `watched` - Done Watching
