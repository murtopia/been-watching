# Session Update - October 20, 2025

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed Activity Feed Bug on User Profiles
**Problem**: Taylor's activities (and other users') weren't showing on their profile pages, even though they had 205 activities in the database.

**Root Cause**:
- Database query was using incorrect column names
- Activities table uses `activity_type` and `activity_data` columns
- Query was trying to select non-existent `type`, `rating`, and `status` columns

**Solution**:
- Updated `Activity` interface to match actual schema ([page.tsx:20-36](app/user/[username]/page.tsx#L20-L36))
- Fixed `loadActivities` query to use correct column names ([page.tsx:180-211](app/user/[username]/page.tsx#L180-L211))
- Added `!left` for LEFT JOIN to include activities even if media records are missing
- Updated `formatActivityText` to use new structure ([page.tsx:308-321](app/user/[username]/page.tsx#L308-L321))

### 2. Fixed Browser Console Errors (params.username)
**Problem**: Next.js 15 console errors about `params.username` being accessed directly

**Solution**:
- Imported `use` from React
- Changed params type from `{ params: { username: string } }` to `{ params: Promise<{ username: string }> }`
- Unwrapped params with `const { username } = use(params)`
- Updated all references from `params.username` to `username`

### 3. Added User Profile Enhancements
Successfully implemented the features requested:

#### Top 3 Shows Section
- Displays user's top 3 shows with numbered badges (1, 2, 3)
- Blue circular badges (#0095f6) matching My Shows page design
- Shows poster images from TMDB
- Empty state with "Not set" message
- Clickable to open detail modal

#### Watch Lists Section
- Three tabs: Want to Watch / Watching / Watched
- Displays counts for each list integrated into tabs (e.g., "29" above "Want to Watch")
- Grid layout of show posters
- **Rating badges** on each poster (‚ù§Ô∏è for love, üëç for like, üòê for meh)
- **Clickable posters** that open MediaDetailModal for interaction
- Filters out orphaned activities without media records
- Loading states and empty states

#### Privacy & Permissions
- All sections respect `canViewActivities` check
- Private profiles show lock icon with message
- Non-followers can't see content from private profiles

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

#### Rating Badges Everywhere
**File Modified**: [app/myshows/page.tsx](app/myshows/page.tsx#L693-L731)

Added rating badge overlays to My Shows grid view:
- Circular badges in bottom-right corner of posters
- Emoji ratings: ‚ù§Ô∏è (love), üëç (like), üòê (meh)
- Dark translucent background with backdrop blur
- Consistent with user profile watch list design

#### Clickable Posters on User Profiles
**File Modified**: [app/user/[username]/page.tsx](app/user/[username]/page.tsx)

Made all show posters clickable on user profiles:
- Added MediaDetailModal import (line 7)
- Added modal state management (lines 62-63)
- Created handleShowClick function (lines 330-340)
- Added onClick handler to posters (line 803)
- Added modal component with callbacks (lines 962-980)
- Users can now add shows they see on others' profiles to their own lists

#### Sticky Navigation Header
**File Modified**: [app/user/[username]/page.tsx](app/user/[username]/page.tsx#L409-L493)

Added sticky navigation at top of user profile pages:
- Always visible when scrolling (position: sticky)
- Back button (‚Üê) with hover effect
- Profile username and display name
- Follow/Following button for quick access
- Frosted glass effect (backdrop blur)
- Professional, app-like navigation

#### Design System Consistency
**File Modified**: [app/user/[username]/page.tsx](app/user/[username]/page.tsx)

Updated user profile pages to match own profile page design:
- Changed container width from 800px to 600px
- Reduced avatar size from 100px to 60px
- Reduced all font sizes to match profile page
- Updated spacing and padding throughout
- Removed excessive borders and rounded corners
- More mobile-friendly, tighter layout

#### Watch List Tabs with Integrated Counts
**File Modified**: [app/user/[username]/page.tsx](app/user/[username]/page.tsx#L748-L844)

Updated watch list tabs to show counts prominently:
- Large count numbers (2rem) displayed above each tab label
- Tab labels in smaller text below (0.875rem)
- Blue highlighting (#0095f6) on active tab
- 3px solid border on active tab
- Removed redundant stats row section
- Layout: "29" above "Want to Watch", "13" above "Watching", "97" above "Watched"

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Used LEFT JOIN (`!left`) for activities query to handle missing media records gracefully
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Maintained consistent design language across all sections
- Limited initial watch list loads to 20 items for performance
