# Session Summary - October 26, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing several UI/UX bugs and improvements, with the primary focus being a critical year display bug showing 5-digit years instead of 4-digit years.

## Major Changes

### 1. Fixed 5-Digit Year Display Bug ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**: Shows like "The X-Files" (1997) were displaying as "19970" instead of "1997"

**Root Cause**: React's conditional rendering with `&&` operator was rendering `0` when `vote_average` was 0 (falsy value). The expression `{media.vote_average && ...}` would evaluate to `0` when vote_average was 0, and React renders `0` as text (unlike `null`, `undefined`, or `false` which it ignores).

**Solution**:
- Changed conditional from `{media.vote_average && ...}` to `{media.vote_average > 0 && ...}` in [MediaCard.tsx:105](components/media/MediaCard.tsx#L105)
- Created utility functions in [utils/dateFormatting.ts](utils/dateFormatting.ts):
  - `safeFormatDate()` - Validates and formats dates to ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `safeExtractYear()` - Extracts exactly 4-digit years, never more

**Files Modified**:
- [components/media/MediaCard.tsx](components/media/MediaCard.tsx#L105) - Main fix
- [utils/dateFormatting.ts](utils/dateFormatting.ts) - New utility functions
- [components/feed/ActivityCard.tsx](components/feed/ActivityCard.tsx) - Applied safe formatting
- [components/search/TVSeasonCard.tsx](components/search/TVSeasonCard.tsx#L108) - Applied safe formatting
- [components/profile/TopShowModal.tsx](components/profile/TopShowModal.tsx) - Applied safe formatting
- [app/feed/page.tsx](app/feed/page.tsx#L652) - Applied safe formatting
- [app/myshows/page.tsx](app/myshows/page.tsx) - Applied safe formatting

### 2. Added Logo to App Header
**Change**: Added Been Watching logo to the app header (non-clickable)

**Files Modified**:
- [components/navigation/AppHeader.tsx](components/navigation/AppHeader.tsx#L86-L110) - Added logo image and gradient text

**Visual**: Logo appears on all pages with the gradient "Been Watching" text next to it

### 3. Added @Username Display
**Change**: Added @username display between display name and bio on profile pages

**Files Modified**:
- [app/profile/page.tsx](app/profile/page.tsx#L472-L477) - Added @username on own profile
- [app/[username]/page.tsx](app/[username]/page.tsx#L580-L593) - Added @username on public profiles

### 4. Updated Public Profile Pages
**Change**: Replaced custom header with standard AppHeader component and changed "Back" to "Home" button

**Reasoning**:
- Eliminated redundancy (custom header duplicated name/username)
- Home button is more useful for users arriving via shared URL
- Button routes to `/feed` (logged in users) or `/welcome` (logged out users)

**Files Modified**:
- [app/[username]/page.tsx](app/[username]/page.tsx#L463-L511) - New header structure

### 5. Created Password Reset Page
**Change**: Added complete password reset flow at `/auth/reset-password`

**Features**:
- Password validation (min 6 characters)
- Confirm password matching
- Success message with auto-redirect to login
- Error handling
- Theme toggle support
- Styled to match existing auth pages

**Files Created**:
- [app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx](app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx) - New password reset page

**User Flow**:
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. Enters email, receives Supabase reset email
3. Clicks link in email → redirected to `/auth/reset-password`
4. Enters new password (with confirmation)
5. Success → auto-redirected to `/auth` login page

### 6. Updated Invite Share Text
**Old Message**:
"I just earned an invite to Been Watching... Come join me and try it out"

**New Message**:
"I just got an invite code to Been Watching, a new social show and movie discovery platform that I think you'd like! Come join me see what I've been watching here: https://beenwatching.com/join/[username]"

**Files Modified**:
- [components/profile/InviteSection.tsx](components/profile/InviteSection.tsx#L104) - Updated both share and copy functions

## Technical Details

### The Year Bug Deep Dive
The bug was particularly tricky because:
1. HTML inspector showed `<span>1997</span>` followed by text node `"0"`
2. Initial hypothesis was TMDB API sending malformed dates
3. Created extensive debugging in date utilities
4. User screenshots revealed the `0` was a separate text node
5. Final discovery: `{media.vote_average && <Component />}` renders `0` when vote_average is 0

**React Behavior**:
- `{false && <Component />}` → renders nothing ✓
- `{null && <Component />}` → renders nothing ✓
- `{undefined && <Component />}` → renders nothing ✓
- `{0 && <Component />}` → renders "0" ✗ (THE BUG)

**Fix**: Change to `{value > 0 && <Component />}` to ensure boolean evaluation

### Date Formatting Utilities
Created centralized utilities to prevent future date-related bugs:

```typescript
// Always returns valid ISO date or null
safeFormatDate(dateString)
// Example: "1997" → "1997-01-01"
// Example: "1997-09-10" → "1997-09-10"

// Always returns exactly 4 digits or null
safeExtractYear(dateString)
// Example: "1997-09-10" → "1997"
// Example: "19970" → "1997" (extracts first 4 digits)
```

## User Feedback
"fuck yeah! finally solved, nice work!" - After fixing the year display bug

## Pending Tasks (For Later)
- Email template branding - Customize Supabase email templates with Been Watching branding

## Deployment
All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository: `murtopia/been-watching`
Commit hash: `b0ec548`
Branch: `main`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify year display on older shows (pre-2000) - especially shows with 0 vote_average
2. Test password reset flow end-to-end
3. Verify @username displays correctly on all profile pages
4. Test Home button functionality on public profiles (both logged in and logged out)
5. Test invite share functionality with new message text
