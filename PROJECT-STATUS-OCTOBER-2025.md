## üéâ What We Just Completed (October 25, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Invite System V2 - COMPLETE
**Status**: Fully deployed to production
**Impact**: Game-changing feature for controlled growth

#### What We Built
1. **Profile Completion Requirements**
   - Users must complete 6 tasks to earn their invite:
     - ‚úÖ Add avatar
     - ‚úÖ Write bio
     - ‚úÖ Select top 3 shows
     - ‚úÖ Add shows to Want to Watch
     - ‚úÖ Add shows to Currently Watching
     - ‚úÖ Add shows to Watched
   - Real-time progress tracking with checkboxes
   - Automatic invite award when all tasks complete

2. **Invite Sharing System**
   - Clean invite links: `beenwatching.app/join/username`
   - Native Web Share API integration (iOS, Android)
   - Clipboard fallback for desktop browsers
   - Custom share messaging per platform

3. **Referral Dashboard**
   - See who you've invited with status badges
   - Track invitation status (Pending ‚Üí Joined ‚Üí Active)
   - Click referral to view their profile
   - Shows join date for completed invites

4. **Auto-Follow System**
   - New users automatically follow their inviter
   - One-way connection (invitee follows inviter)
   - No mutual follow requirement
   - Builds initial social graph

5. **Atomic Invite Redemption**
   - Database-level locks prevent race conditions
   - First signup gets the invite slot
   - Everyone else sees "Invite no longer available"
   - Waitlist CTA for expired links

6. **Reserved Usernames**
   - 50+ system paths protected: `join`, `feed`, `profile`, `admin`, `api`, etc.
   - Prevents routing conflicts
   - User-friendly error messages

#### Database Schema
**New Tables:**
- `referrals` - Tracks invite relationships and status

**New Columns:**
- `profiles.profile_invite_earned` - Boolean flag
- `profiles.invited_by` - UUID reference to inviter

**New Functions:**
- `check_profile_completion()` - Returns 6 completion criteria
- `award_profile_completion_invite()` - Grants invite when earned
- `redeem_invite()` - Atomic invite redemption with locks

**Files Created:**
- `/supabase/migrations/add-invite-system-v2.sql`
- `/components/profile/InviteSection.tsx`
- `/components/profile/ReferralDashboard.tsx`
- `/app/join/[username]/page.tsx`
- `/utils/profileCompletion.ts`

---

### ‚úÖ URL Structure Improvements - COMPLETE
**Status**: Fully deployed

#### What Changed
- **Old Format**: `beenwatching.app/user/[username]`
- **New Format**: `beenwatching.app/[username]`
- **Benefits**: Cleaner, more shareable, standard social app pattern

#### Updated References
‚úÖ Feed activity cards
‚úÖ Notification links
‚úÖ Search results
‚úÖ Referral dashboard
‚úÖ Follower/following lists
‚úÖ Top 3 show links

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/[username]/page.tsx` (renamed from `/app/user/[username]/page.tsx`)
- `/app/feed/page.tsx`
- `/components/notifications/NotificationDropdown.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ Critical Bug Fixes - COMPLETE

#### Bug Fix 1: Watch List Removal Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking to remove a show from watch list showed confirmation but didn't actually delete
**Root Cause**: Status buttons passed `undefined` instead of `null` to trigger removal
**Solution**:
- Updated `MediaCard.tsx` to pass `null` when unchecking status
- Fixed `myshows/page.tsx` confirmRemoval to pass `null` instead of `undefined`
- Proper null checks in database update logic

**Files Fixed:**
- `/components/media/MediaCard.tsx`
- `/app/myshows/page.tsx`

#### Bug Fix 2: Year Display Showing "20240"
**Problem**: Some movies/shows displayed malformed years (e.g., "20240" instead of "2024")
**Root Cause**: Using `new Date().getFullYear()` on malformed date strings
**Solution**: Changed to safer `.substring(0, 4)` method
**Files Fixed:**
- `/components/media/MediaCard.tsx`
- `/components/feed/ActivityCard.tsx`
- `/components/profile/TopShowModal.tsx`

**Status**: May require hard browser refresh due to caching

#### Bug Fix 3: Top 3 Shows Dark Mode Issues
**Problem 1**: Empty Top 3 slots showed white boxes in dark mode
**Problem 2**: User profile Top 3 missing glowing orange outline
**Solutions**:
- Changed empty state from hardcoded `#f0f0f0` to theme-aware `colors.cardBg`
- Added dashed border for empty slots in dark mode
- Added glowing orange boxShadow to match "My Shows" page styling
- Added smooth transitions

**Files Fixed:**
- `/app/[username]/page.tsx`

## üöß In Progress / Needs Work

### High Priority

#### 1. Episode-Level Tracking
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Started

**Needs:**
- Pagination/infinite scroll (currently shows all)
- Combine related activities (add + rate + comment = 1 activity)

## ‚ùì Open Questions

### For Nick to Answer
1. **Episode Tracking**: How should we handle weekly TV releases?
2. **Show Notes**: Should they appear as feed items or just on show pages?
3. **Notifications**: On-device push notifications or just in-app?
4. **Search**: How smart should fuzzy matching be? (performance vs accuracy)
5. **Invite Strategy**: Tiered release plan vs immediate invite earning?

### Technical Decisions Needed
1. Should we build native mobile apps or focus on PWA?
2. When to add algorithmic feed vs staying chronological?
3. How to handle spam/abuse at scale?
4. Database optimization strategy as user base grows?
5. Caching strategy for TMDB API calls?
