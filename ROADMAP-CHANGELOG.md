### Moved Episode Tracking from Critical to High Priority

**Changed by:** Nick Murto

**What changed:**
- Episode-level tracking moved from "Critical Priority (Next 2 Weeks)" to "High Priority (Next Month)"
- Show Notes feature promoted to top Critical priority
- Updated v0.2.0 milestone to not require episode tracking

**Reasoning:**
After user feedback from alpha testers, realized Show Notes is more important for initial engagement than episode granularity. Users are happy with season-level tracking for now. Episode tracking can wait until we have more content and social activity.

**Impact:**
- Timeline: v0.2.0 beta can launch 1 week earlier without episode tracking
- Development: Frees up 2-3 days of dev time to focus on Show Notes
- Users: No negative impact - season tracking meets current needs
```
