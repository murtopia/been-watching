# Current State Assessment & Action Plan

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: Project needs assessment and careful recovery from today's problematic changes

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the partial history from last night's successful work and examining today's changes, it's clear that premature code and database modifications were made without proper research. This document provides a comprehensive assessment and proposes a careful action plan.

---

## 1. What Happened Last Night (SUCCESS)

Based on `partial history.txt` review:

### ‚úÖ Successful Accomplishments
- **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production
- **Environment Variables**: Added all required env vars via Vercel CLI:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN`
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Migration Progress**: Created Boozehounds migration scripts
- **Database**: Nick's watch data was being successfully migrated
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth was working correctly

### Key State from Last Night
- The application was WORKING on Vercel
- Local development was in sync with production
- Migration system for Apple Notes was functional
- Database had Nick's shows properly tracked

---

## 2. What Went Wrong Today

### ‚ùå Mistakes Made This Session

#### Problem 1: Changed Code Without Research
**Files Modified**:
- `app/myshows/page.tsx` - Added DELETE logic for null status (lines 156-193)
- `components/media/MediaDetailModal.tsx` - Modified media ID lookup and status handling (lines 62, 98-112)

**Issue**: These changes were made based on incomplete understanding:
- Didn't verify if this was actually broken in production
- Didn't test changes properly before implementing
- Made assumptions about how the system should work

#### Problem 2: Database Deletions
**Actions Taken**:
- Attempted to delete "Dept Q" from Nick's list
- Deleted wrong Acapulco entries (tv-8246, tv-8246-s3, tv-8246-s4)

**Issue**:
- Made database changes without full state assessment
- Didn't verify the source of these entries
- No backup or reversibility plan

#### Problem 3: Didn't Validate Current State
**What Should Have Been Done First**:
1. Check what's actually deployed on Vercel (production)
2. Compare local vs production state
3. Read all documentation thoroughly
4. Understand the complete data flow
5. Create this assessment document BEFORE making changes

---

## 3. Current Issues Reported by User

### Issue #1: Unchecking Watch Status Not Working
**User Report**: "if I click on it and see it's details, it shows the box 'want to watch' checked. If I uncheck this, the show should disappear from my want to watch list. However this is not happening"

**Analysis**:
- Modified `MediaDetailModal.tsx` to pass `null` when unchecking
- Modified `myshows/page.tsx` to DELETE when receiving `null`
- User reports this fix isn't working
- **Unknown**: Was this working correctly in production before today's changes?

### Issue #2: Shows Nick Didn't Add
**User Report**: "there are shows in my lists that I never put there"

**Examples**:
- "Dept Q" - appears with no watch status highlighted
- Wrong "Acapulco" version (1961 instead of 2021 Apple TV+ show)

**Analysis**:
- Could be from migration script importing wrong data
- Could be from TMDB matching errors
- Need to audit Nick's full watch_status and media tables

### Issue #3: Watch Status Buttons Not Highlighting
**User Report**: "when I look at the show details not of the watch list buttons are highlighted"

**Analysis**:
- Related to Issue #1
- Could be data mismatch (media.id vs tmdb-based IDs)
- Today's changes to media ID logic may have broken this

---

## 4. Current Project State

### Database Schema
```
Tables:
- profiles: User accounts (Nick: murtopia)
- media: Shows/movies with TMDB data
- watch_status: User's want/watching/watched status
- ratings: User's meh/like/love ratings
- follows: Social following relationships
```

### Media ID Format
- **Movies**: `movie-{tmdb_id}`
- **TV Shows** (season-specific): `tv-{tmdb_id}-s{season_number}`
- **TV Shows** (general): `tv-{tmdb_id}` (should not exist for multi-season shows)

### Known Good Data (Per Documentation)
- Nick has ~244 shows in database (as of last count)
- Google OAuth working
- Vercel deployment successful
- TMDB API integration functional

### Unknown State
- Current production (Vercel) behavior - is it working correctly?
- Whether local changes have been deployed to Vercel
- Full inventory of Nick's actual watch_status entries
- Whether migration script created bad data

---

---

## 6. Proposed Action Plan

### üî¥ PHASE 1: STOP & ASSESS (IMMEDIATE)

#### Step 1.1: Verify Production State
**Action**: Check what's actually running on Vercel
```bash
# Visit production site and test:
1. Can Nick log in?
2. Does watch status work correctly?
3. Are shows displaying properly?
4. Does unchecking watch status work?
```

**Goal**: Determine if production is broken or if only local is broken

#### Step 1.2: Inventory Database State
**Action**: Run read-only queries to document:
- All shows in Nick's watch_status
- Shows with no ratings
- Shows with incorrect TMDB matches
- Duplicate entries

**Script Needed**: `scripts/audit-nick-data.js` (read-only)

#### Step 1.3: Review Git Status
**Action**:
```bash
git status
git diff
```

**Goal**: See exactly what local changes exist vs last commit

---

### üü° PHASE 2: REVERT OR FIX (USER DECISION NEEDED)

#### Option A: Revert Today's Changes
**If production is working correctly**:

1. **Revert local code changes**:
   ```bash
   git restore app/myshows/page.tsx
   git restore components/media/MediaDetailModal.tsx
   git restore scripts/migrate-apple-notes.js
   ```

2. **Don't deploy to Vercel** - leave production as-is

3. **Work from known-good state** going forward

#### Option B: Fix Today's Changes
**If production is also broken**:

1. Debug the actual issue with watch status
2. Create proper fix with testing
3. Test locally thoroughly
4. Deploy to Vercel only after verification

---

### üü¢ PHASE 3: DATA CLEANUP

#### Step 3.1: Create Data Audit Script
**File**: `scripts/audit-nick-data.js`

**Purpose**: Read-only analysis that outputs:
- Shows with no watch_status
- Shows with wrong TMDB matches
- Duplicate entries
- Shows that don't match Apple Notes source data

**Review**: User reviews output before any deletions

#### Step 3.2: Create Data Cleanup Script
**File**: `scripts/cleanup-nick-data.js`

**Purpose**:
- Remove identified bad entries
- Fix wrong TMDB matches
- Preserve user's actual watch history

**Process**:
1. Run audit first
2. User reviews proposed changes
3. User approves specific deletions/fixes
4. Run cleanup with confirmation prompts

---

### üîµ PHASE 4: FIX UI ISSUES (If Needed)

#### Step 4.1: Understand Current Watch Status Flow

**Research Questions**:
1. How does MediaDetailModal currently get media.id?
2. How does myshows page receive status updates?
3. What's the expected behavior when unchecking?
4. Is there caching that needs invalidation?

#### Step 4.2: Create Test Plan

**Test Cases**:
- Add show to "Want to Watch"
- Verify it appears in Want to Watch list
- Open show details from list
- Verify "Want to Watch" is highlighted
- Uncheck "Want to Watch"
- Verify show disappears from list
- Verify watch_status row is deleted from DB

#### Step 4.3: Implement Fix (If Needed)

**Only after**:
- Understanding root cause
- Creating test plan
- Getting user approval on approach

---

### üü£ PHASE 5: RESUME MIGRATION WORK

#### Step 5.1: Complete TMDB Matching System

**Needed**:
- Manual review interface for ambiguous matches
- Year-based matching improvements
- Handle Apple TV+ shows specifically (Acapulco example)

#### Step 5.2: Finish Nick's Migration

**Process**:
1. Re-run migration with improved matching
2. Manual review of any ambiguous shows
3. User verifies his complete list is accurate

#### Step 5.3: Onboard Other Boozehounds

**After Nick's data is perfect**:
1. Todd, Taylor, Pat sign up with BOOZEHOUND code
2. Run setup-boozehounds.js
3. Import their Apple Notes data
4. Each user verifies their data

---

## 7. Critical Questions for User

### Question 1: Production State
**Q**: Is the production site on Vercel currently working correctly?
- Can you log in?
- Does unchecking watch status work in production?
- Are your shows displaying correctly?

### Question 2: Priority
**Q**: What's the priority order?
1. Fix current watch status UI issue?
2. Clean up bad data in your list?
3. Resume Boozehounds migration work?

### Question 3: Revert Decision
**Q**: Should we revert today's local code changes and work from the last working state?

---

## 8. Scripts Available

### Existing Scripts (in `/scripts/`)
- `setup-boozehounds.js` - Creates Boozehound profiles and mutual follows
- `migrate-apple-notes.js` - Imports watch data from Apple Notes
- `delete-duplicate-wants.js` - Removes duplicate TV entries
- `delete-general-tv-shows.js` - Removes non-season-specific TV shows
- `check-season-format.js` - Inspects season storage format

### Scripts Needed
- ‚úÖ `audit-nick-data.js` - Read-only analysis of Nick's data
- ‚úÖ `cleanup-nick-data.js` - Approved data cleanup operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `verify-production.js` - Check production DB state vs local
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `tmdb-matching-review.js` - Manual review interface for ambiguous matches

---

## 9. Next Immediate Steps

### Before Making ANY Changes:

1. **User Input Required**:
   - Answer the 3 critical questions above
   - Test production site behavior
   - Decide on revert vs fix approach

2. **Create Audit Script**:
   - Read-only analysis
   - No database modifications
   - Output report for user review

3. **Wait for Approval**:
   - Do NOT modify code
   - Do NOT modify database
   - Do NOT deploy anything

## 10. Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong Today:
1. ‚ùå Made code changes without researching current state
2. ‚ùå Modified database without full audit
3. ‚ùå Didn't verify production vs local differences
4. ‚ùå Didn't read documentation thoroughly first
5. ‚ùå Didn't create assessment plan before acting

### What Should Happen Going Forward:
1. ‚úÖ Always check production state first
2. ‚úÖ Create read-only audit scripts before modifications
3. ‚úÖ Get user approval on proposed changes
4. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly in local before deploying
5. ‚úÖ Document state before and after changes
6. ‚úÖ Make small, reversible changes
7. ‚úÖ Verify each change works before moving to next
