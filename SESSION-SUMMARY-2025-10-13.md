  - Used `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`
  - Added `min-width: 0` to `.show-card`
  - Created `.poster-container` wrapper with `height: 0` and `padding-bottom: 150%` for consistent aspect ratio

## 🔧 KEY FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Activities Creation**
- **Problem:** User had 0 activities despite having 13 ratings, so dummy data was showing
- **Solution:** Created SQL migration `supabase/create-activities-from-ratings.sql`
- **Result:** 13 real activities created from existing ratings
- **Status:** ✅ APPLIED - User will see real activities on next refresh

### 2. **CSS Truncation Fix**
- **Problem:** "more" button expanded but CSS still truncated to 2 lines
- **Solution:** Added `.feed-show-overview.expanded` class to remove `-webkit-line-clamp`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. **Data Fetching Enhancement**
- **Updated:** `app/page.tsx` `loadFeed()` function (lines 97-150)
- **Now fetches:**
  - All likes with user info (`activity_likes` join with `profiles`)
  - All comments with user info (`comments` join with `profiles`)
  - User's own rating for each media
  - User's own watch status for each media
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented

## 🔄 DEV SERVER STATUS

**Running processes:**
- Background Bash 65b90c: `npm run dev` at port 3000
- Status: ✅ Running
- URL: http://localhost:3000

**Note:** Page must be refreshed to see real activities instead of dummy data

## 📊 DATA INTEGRITY VERIFIED

✅ User ID matches across all tables: `a59a9556-6bbc-422b-af13-59d61a1f7ebe`
✅ All 13 ratings owned by Nick
✅ All 23 watch_status records owned by Nick
✅ All 13 activities owned by Nick

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (After Testing)

If testing reveals issues:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify activities are loading (should see Nick's activities, not dummy)
3. Check network tab for 400/409 errors
4. Run SQL query to verify data after interactions:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM activity_likes;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments;
   ```

If everything works:
1. Consider adding more features:
   - Edit comments
   - Reply to comments
   - Filter activities by type
   - Friend system (tables don't exist yet)
2. Continue with original plan to migrate old data

}

const getLikeText = () => {
  if (activity.user_liked) {
    return activity.like_count === 1 ? 'You' : `You and ${activity.like_count - 1} other${activity.like_count - 1 > 1 ? 's' : ''}`

}
```
