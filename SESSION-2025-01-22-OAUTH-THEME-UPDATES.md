# Session Summary: January 22, 2025
## OAuth Configuration & Theme System Improvements

### Overview
This session focused on three main areas:
1. **Theme system consistency** across auth, welcome, privacy, and terms pages
2. **Google OAuth verification** setup and troubleshooting
3. **Dark mode fixes** for the myshows page

---

## 1. Theme System Updates

### Problem
- Auth, welcome, privacy, and terms pages had inconsistent theme implementations
- Some pages used manual `isDarkMode` state with 3-button selectors (Light/Dark/Auto)
- Privacy and terms pages lacked proper theme integration
- Back buttons and theme toggles were positioned outside content bubbles

### Solution
Updated 4 pages to use the centralized `ThemeContext`:

#### Files Modified:
1. **`/app/auth/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced 3-button theme selector with single `ThemeToggle` component
   - Moved Back button and Theme toggle inside the card bubble at top edges
   - Changed from `theme`/`setTheme`/`isDarkMode` to `resolvedTheme` pattern

2. **`/app/welcome/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced 3-button theme selector with single `ThemeToggle` component
   - Fixed theme toggle positioning (top-right, fixed)
   - Updated to use `resolvedTheme` from `useTheme()` hook

3. **`/app/privacy/page.tsx`** (Created new)
   - Added `ThemeToggle` component
   - Wrapped content in card bubble design matching auth page
   - Added Back button and Theme toggle at top edges inside card
   - Updated `maxWidth` from 800px to 600px for consistency
   - Added gradient background for dark mode
   - Removed invite tier line: "Invite codes may grant different tiers of access (Boozehound, Alpha, Beta)"

4. **`/app/terms/page.tsx`** (Created new)
   - Same updates as privacy page
   - Card bubble structure with proper theme support
   - Back and Theme buttons positioned inside bubble

### Key Pattern Established:
```typescript
import { useTheme } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext'
import ThemeToggle from '@/components/theme/ThemeToggle'

const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme()
const isDarkMode = resolvedTheme === 'dark'

// Use theme variables:
const cardBg = isDarkMode ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)' : '#ffffff'
const cardBorder = isDarkMode ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)' : '#f0f0f0'
const textPrimary = isDarkMode ? '#ffffff' : '#1a1a1a'
const textSecondary = isDarkMode ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)' : '#666'
```

### Commits:
- `8bab80f` - "Update theme system and layout for auth, welcome, privacy, and terms pages"

## 2. Dark Mode Fixes for MyShows Page

### Problem
Show cards on the profile "Watched" tab had white backgrounds instead of matching the dark semi-transparent cards in the activity feed.

### Solution
Updated `/app/myshows/page.tsx`:
- Changed list view cards from hardcoded `background: '#fafafa'` to theme-based `cardBg`
- Added `cardBorder` for proper styling
- Added `backdropFilter: backdropBlur` for glass morphism effect
- Updated title text to use `textPrimary` color
- Changed empty state color from hardcoded `'#999'` to `textSecondary`

### Files Modified:
- **`/app/myshows/page.tsx`** (lines 683-689, 708, 730)

### Commits:
- `3fcc448` - "Fix dark mode styling for myshows page"

## 3. Google OAuth Setup & Verification

### Configuration Review
Reviewed and verified Google Cloud Console OAuth settings:

#### OAuth Consent Screen (Correctly Configured):
- ✅ **App name**: "Been Watching"
- ✅ **User support email**: nick@seven2.com
- ✅ **App logo**: Uploaded (120x120px TV icon)
- ✅ **Application home page**: `https://beenwatching.com`
- ✅ **Privacy policy**: `https://beenwatching.com/privacy`
- ✅ **Terms of service**: `https://beenwatching.com/terms`
- ✅ **Authorized domains**: `beenwatching.com`, `udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co`
- ✅ **Contact email**: nick@seven2.com

#### OAuth 2.0 Client Configuration:
- **Client ID**: `393098758325-isk2oaa6hakt61hprpt1s5fapm2f65gu.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Client Secret**: Configured (hidden)

**Authorized JavaScript Origins:**
- `https://udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co`
- `https://beenwatching.com`
- `https://www.beenwatching.com`
- ❌ Missing: `http://localhost:3000` (recommended for local dev)

**Authorized Redirect URIs:**
- `https://beenwatching.com/api/auth/callback`
- `https://www.beenwatching.com/api/auth/callback`
- `https://udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- ❌ Missing: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` (recommended for local dev)

#### Supabase Configuration:
Verified Google OAuth settings in Supabase dashboard:
- ✅ **Enable Sign in with Google**: ON
- ✅ **Client ID**: Matches Google Cloud Console
- ✅ **Client Secret**: Configured
- ✅ **Callback URL**: `https://udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**Critical Fix:**
- Updated Supabase **Site URL** from incomplete `https://been-watching-` to `https://beenwatching.com`

### Verification Submission
Submitted app for Google OAuth verification:

**Additional Info Provided:**
```
Been Watching is a social TV tracking application where users track shows/movies, rate content, and share viewing activity with friends.

OAuth Purpose: We use Google OAuth solely for user authentication to provide seamless sign-in. We only request email address and basic profile information (name) to create and manage user accounts.

Data Usage: Email and profile data obtained through Google OAuth is used exclusively for:
- Creating and identifying user accounts
- User login authentication
- Displaying user profiles in the app
- Sending account-related notifications (if opted in)

Privacy: We do not share, sell, or use Google user data beyond authentication and core app functionality. Full privacy policy: https://beenwatching.com/privacy

Testing: The app is invite-only during alpha/beta. Test invite codes available upon request.

Technical Details: Primary OAuth client for Been Watching using Supabase (udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co) as authentication backend. Primary domain beenwatching.com deployed on Vercel.
```

**Status**: Submitted for review
**Expected Timeline**: 3-7 business days (can take up to 2 weeks)

### OAuth Consent Screen Issue
**Problem**: Consent screen shows "continue to udfhqiipppybkuxpycay.supabase.co" instead of "BeenWatching.com"

**Root Cause**: Google caches OAuth consent screens aggressively. Even with correct configuration, changes can take **up to 24 hours** to propagate.

**Workarounds to See Updated Branding:**
1. Try with a **different Google account** (never used with the app before)
2. Use **incognito/private window** with cleared cache
3. Clear browser cache completely for `accounts.google.com`
4. Wait for propagation (15 minutes to 24 hours)

**Technical Configuration**: All settings are correct - this is purely a caching issue.

## 6. Technical Patterns Established

### Theme Toggle Component
Single button that cycles through modes: Auto → Light → Dark

```typescript
import ThemeToggle from '@/components/theme/ThemeToggle'

// Usage:
<ThemeToggle />
```

### Theme Context Hook
```typescript
import { useTheme } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext'

const { resolvedTheme, themeMode, setThemeMode, cycleTheme } = useTheme()
const isDarkMode = resolvedTheme === 'dark'
```

### Default Theme
Dark mode is the default (`themeMode` starts as `'dark'` in ThemeContext:19)

### Layout Consistency
- **Max width**: 600px for content (420px for auth card)
- **Card styling**: Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- **Gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #0a0a0a 0%, #1a0a1a 100%)` for dark mode
- **Border radius**: 24px for cards, 12px for smaller elements

## 10. Key Learnings

1. **Google OAuth Cache**: Consent screen branding changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate, even with correct configuration.

2. **Theme Consistency**: Using a centralized ThemeContext with `resolvedTheme` prevents theme mismatches across pages.

3. **Dark Mode Variables**: Defining theme variables at the component level (rather than hardcoding) makes it easy to maintain consistency.

4. **Card Bubble Pattern**: Wrapping content in cards with semi-transparent backgrounds and backdrop blur creates a modern, cohesive design.

5. **Verification Requirements**: Google OAuth verification requires comprehensive privacy policy, terms of service, and clear data usage explanation.
