# Launch Invite System Setup Guide

## What Was The Problem?

You were getting the error: `ERROR: 42703: column "code" does not exist`

**Root Cause**: Your database already had an `invites` table (for friend-to-friend invites), but we were trying to create a new `invites` table for master codes (BOOZEHOUND, BWALPHA), causing a naming conflict.

## The Solution

We renamed everything to avoid conflicts:
- Old conflicting table: `invites` (already exists for friend invites)
- **New table**: `master_codes` (for BOOZEHOUND, BWALPHA, etc.)
- **New view**: `admin_master_code_stats` (for admin dashboard)
- **New functions**: `is_master_code_valid()`, `use_master_code()`, `create_bwalpha_code()`

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click on **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `/supabase/add-launch-invite-system.sql`
5. Click **Run**

You should see success messages like:
```
‚úÖ Launch invite system migration completed successfully!
üìù BOOZEHOUND code created (unlimited uses)
üéØ To generate a BWALPHA code, run: SELECT create_bwalpha_code();
```

### Step 2: Generate Your First BWALPHA Code

In the same SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT create_bwalpha_code();
```

This will return something like: `BWALPHA_K3H9N2P7`

You can run this command 5 times to create the 5 BWALPHA codes you need for your social media launch.

### Step 3: Test the System

#### Test Signup Flow:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter email/password
4. Use invite code: `BOOZEHOUND` or one of your `BWALPHA_XXXXXXXX` codes
5. Create account

#### Test Waitlist:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/waitlist`
2. Enter email
3. Check position number

#### Test Admin Dashboard:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. View all master codes and their usage
3. Create new codes using the buttons

## What Was Created

### New Database Tables

#### 1. `master_codes`
Tracks all launch invite codes:
- `BOOZEHOUND` - unlimited uses
- `BWALPHA_XXXXXXXX` - 5 uses each
- Future codes you create

#### 2. `waitlist`
Collects emails from people without codes:
- Auto-assigns position numbers
- Tracks who gets converted to users

### New Profile Columns

Added to `profiles` table:
- `invited_by_master_code` - which code was used (BOOZEHOUND, BWALPHA_XXX)
- `invite_tier` - boozehound, alpha, or beta
- `invites_remaining` - how many friend invites they can send
- `invites_used` - how many they've sent
- `is_approved` - for waitlist approval flow

### Invite Allocation

When someone signs up:
- **BOOZEHOUND** users get: 10 friend invites
- **BWALPHA** users get: 3 friend invites
- **Beta** users get: 0 friend invites (for now)

## Pages Created

1. **[/app/auth/page.tsx](../app/auth/page.tsx)** - Signup/Login with invite code validation
2. **[/app/waitlist/page.tsx](../app/waitlist/page.tsx)** - Email collection for people without codes
3. **[/app/admin/page.tsx](../app/admin/page.tsx)** - Admin dashboard to manage codes
4. **[/app/profile/page.tsx](../app/profile/page.tsx)** - Updated to show remaining invites

## Verify Everything Works

After running the migration, check these queries in SQL Editor:

### Check BOOZEHOUND code exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM master_codes WHERE code = 'BOOZEHOUND';
```

### Check all master codes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_master_code_stats;
```

### Check profile columns exist:
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
  AND column_name IN ('invited_by_master_code', 'invite_tier', 'invites_remaining');
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the migration (`add-launch-invite-system.sql`)
2. ‚úÖ Generate 5 BWALPHA codes
3. ‚úÖ Test signup with BOOZEHOUND
4. ‚úÖ Test signup with BWALPHA code
5. ‚úÖ Test waitlist
6. Share codes with Taylor, Pat, Todd, and your social media followers!

## Troubleshooting

### "Function does not exist" error
Make sure you ran the full migration - the functions are created at the bottom of the file.

### "Table already exists" error
This is fine! The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so it won't overwrite existing data.

### Can't see invite codes in admin dashboard
Make sure you're logged in and the view has permissions. The migration grants `SELECT` access to authenticated users.

### BOOZEHOUND code says "invalid"
Check that it was inserted:
```sql
SELECT * FROM master_codes WHERE code = 'BOOZEHOUND';
```

If it's missing, insert it manually:
```sql
INSERT INTO master_codes (code, type, max_uses, is_active)
VALUES ('BOOZEHOUND', 'master_unlimited', NULL, true);
```
