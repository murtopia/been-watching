## Priority Matrix

### üî• Critical Priority (Next 2 Weeks)
**Must-have features for expanding beyond alpha testers**

#### 1. Episode-Level Tracking
**Status:** Not Started
**Complexity:** High
**Why Critical:** Users want to track which episode they're on, not just which season

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// New media ID format:
'tv-110492-s1'        // Current: Season-level
'tv-110492-s1e5'      // New: Episode-level

// Optional episode tracking:
- If no episode specified, defaults to season-level
- Users can optionally mark current episode
- "Mark Season Complete" bulk action
```

**Database Changes:**
- Add `episode_number` column to `watch_status` (nullable)
- Add `total_episodes` to `media` table for progress tracking
- Update activity triggers to handle episode data

**UI Changes:**
- Episode selector in MediaDetailModal
- Episode progress indicator (e.g., "5/10 episodes")
- "Next Episode" quick action button

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

---

#### 2. Show Notes Feature (KILLER FEATURE)
**Status:** Database Ready, UI Not Built
**Complexity:** Medium
**Why Critical:** Core differentiator, Twitter-like micro-reviews

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// show_notes table (already created):
- id: UUID
- user_id: UUID
- media_id: TEXT
- note_text: TEXT (max 280 chars)
- visibility: 'public' | 'private'
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ

// Features:

- Appears on media detail pages
```

**UI Locations:**

- Media Detail: All public notes for this show

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days

---

#### 3. Notification System (UI)
**Status:** Database Complete, No UI
**Complexity:** Medium
**Why Critical:** Users need to know when people interact with their content

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Use ‚ú® sparkle icon (NOT bell icon)
// Types to support:
- 'like': Someone liked your activity
- 'comment': Someone commented on your activity
- 'follow': Someone followed you
- 'show_note': Someone added a note to a show you love

// UI Requirements:
- Sparkle icon in header (count badge if unread)
- Dropdown with recent notifications
- Click notification ‚Üí navigate to relevant page
- Mark as read on click
- "Mark all as read" button
```

**Database Already Has:**
- `notifications` table with all fields

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

- Notification when mentioned
- Mention parsing and link generation

**Technical:**
```typescript
// Parse mentions:
const text = "You gotta watch this @taylormurto!"
const mentions = text.match(/@[\w_]+/g)
// ["@taylormurto"]

// Store in activity_data:
{
  mentions: ["user-id-here"],
  raw_text: "You gotta watch this @taylormurto!"
}

// Render as links:
<span>You gotta watch this <a href="/user/taylormurto">@taylormurto</a>!</span>

### üö´ Features We're NOT Building

#### Direct Messages (DMs)
**Decision:** Intentionally not building
**Reasoning:**
- Encourages public discussion and community
- Reduces moderation burden
- Keeps focus on shared content, not private convos
- Alternative: Comments and show notes are public by design

#### Stories/Temporary Content
**Decision:** Not building
**Reasoning:**
- Everything should be permanent and searchable
- No FOMO pressure on users
- Easier to build discovery features with permanent content

#### Video/Photo Upload
**Decision:** Not building
**Reasoning:**
- Expensive to host and moderate
- Focus on text-based content and discussions
- TMDB provides all media we need

#### Algorithmic Feed
**Decision:** Chronological only
**Reasoning:**
- Transparency: users know what they're seeing
- No engagement manipulation
- Simple and predictable

   - Advanced statistics and insights
   - Export to more formats
   - Unlimited top shows (free: 3, premium: 10)
   - Custom profile themes
   - Priority support

2. **Streaming Service Affiliate Links**
   - "Watch on Netflix" button with referral tracking

   - Non-intrusive, adds value for users

3. **B2B API Access**
   - Studios/networks can access aggregated data
   - Trend analysis and audience insights
   - Premium pricing for commercial use

**Will NOT Do:**
- Traditional ads (ruins user experience)
- Sell user data (violates trust)
- Freemium with severe limitations (keeps core features free)

## Community Guidelines Enforcement

### Current State
- Guidelines page exists
- No enforcement tools yet
- Relying on small, trusted community

### Before Public Launch (v1.0.0)

   - Categories: Spam, harassment, inappropriate content
   - Queue for admin review

2. **Moderation Tools**
   - Admin dashboard for reports
   - Ban user functionality
   - Delete activity/comment
   - Issue warnings

3. **Automated Detection**
   - Spam detection (repeated content)
   - Profanity filter (optional toggle per user)
   - Rate limiting on posts

4. **Appeals Process**
   - Users can appeal bans
   - Transparent reasoning for actions
   - Restoration if appeal accepted

## Development Principles

### Core Values
1. **User Privacy First:** Minimal data collection, maximum control
2. **Transparency:** Open about roadmap, decisions, and data usage
3. **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to have fewer features that work great
4. **Mobile-First:** Optimize for where users actually are (their phones)
5. **Community-Driven:** Listen to users, adapt based on feedback

### Technical Principles
1. **TypeScript Everywhere:** Type safety prevents bugs
2. **Server Components:** Minimize client-side JavaScript
3. **Accessible by Default:** Don't add features that aren't accessible
4. **Performance Matters:** Fast load times = happy users
5. **Simple Architecture:** Avoid over-engineering

## Questions to Resolve

### Before v0.2.0
- [ ] Should episode tracking be optional or mandatory?
- [ ] Should show notes appear as their own feed item or attached to ratings?
- [ ] What notification types are most important to users?

### Before v1.0.0
- [ ] How do we handle spam and abuse at scale?
- [ ] Should we build native mobile apps or focus on PWA?
- [ ] What's the right balance of public vs private features?
- [ ] How do we differentiate from competitors long-term?
