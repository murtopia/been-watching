## Questions for You:

1. Some shows have seasons listed (like "Fargo s2", "Fargo s3") - do you want to track individual seasons or just the show as a whole? - everything we are doing tracks individual seasons, never the show itself as a whole.

2. I see some duplicates (Fargo appears 3 times, Tokyo Vice twice, etc.) - should I keep all entries or consolidate? - consolidate

3. For the "NEEDS REVIEW" section above - should I manually fix the wrong matches (marked with ❌)? - refer to my notes for each
